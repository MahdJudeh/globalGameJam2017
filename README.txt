GitHub architecture:
root>stage>repository>server


Setup:
1. git ignore (google what to ignore)
2. enable visual meta files under version control
3. use force text under asset Serialization


Syncing from the server:
git pull origin master


Pushing to server:
1. git add -A .
2. git commit -m ""
3. git push origin master


Making Branches:
git branch		(shows branches)
git branch name		(makes branch name)
git checkcout name	(selects branch name)>> delete Library and Temp after branch switches
git merge name		(merges branch)

Tips:
use prefabs early
many components interfere least
avoid multiple people on one component
